Welcome to Matt Pell's interview test app!


Download the app files to a local directory on your computer.

Make sure you have latest node and mongodb versions. Install them if not. I'm using Node v10.13.0 and Mongo 4.0.3

Go to the root directory of the app, and in a command prompt type: npm install

In a new terminal or command prompt window, navigate to wherever you keep MongoDB (for example: C:\mongo\bin) 
and set the dbpath to data folder of the app: c:\appLocation\...\fotfBroadcastApp\data

Command C:\mongo\bin\mongod --dbpath c:\testapp\fotfBroadcastApp\data

Mongo db will fire up. Leave it running in the background while testing the app.



Notes: Only the main page fully functions. The archive and add broadcast page were only started but not finished due to time.
